PyQuake3D is a Python-based Boundary Element Method (BEM) code for simulating sequences of seismic and aseismic slip (SEAS) on a complex 3D fault geometry governed by rate- and state-dependent friction. This document provides an overview of how to use the script, as well as a detailed description of the input parameters.

# Contribution
Dr. Rongjiang Tang and Dr. Luca Dal Zilio developed the code framework and the Quasi-dynamic BIEM Seismic cycle model on a complex 3D fault geometry governed by regularized aging law. Dr.Rongjiang Tang and Dr.Luca Dal Zilio implemented the H-matrix Matrix-Vector Multiplication and developed the Cascadia model.

##requirements
numpy>=1.2
ctypes==1.1
python>=3.8

## Running the Script

To run the PyQuake3D script, use the following command:
```bash
python -g --inputgeo <input_geometry_file> -p --inputpara <input_parameter_file>
```
For example,To execute benchmarks like BP5-QD at Current Directory:
```bash
python src/main.py -g --examples/bp5t/bp5t.msh -p --examples/bp5t/parameter.txt
```
To run cascadia model, use:
```bash
python src/main.py -g --examples/cascadia/cascadia35km_ele4.msh -p --examples/cascadia/parameter.txt
```
Ensure you modify the input parameter (`parameter.txt`) as follows:
- `Corefunc directory`: `bp5t_core`
- `InputHetoparamter`: `True`
- `Inputparamter file`: `bp5tparam.dat`

## Input Parameter Description

### General Parameters

| Parameter                   | Default | Description |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `Corefunc directory`        |         | The storage path for the kernel function matrix composed of stress Green's functions. |
| `InputHetoparamter`         | False   | If `True`, the heterogeneous stress and friction parameters are imported from external files. |
| `Inputparamter file`        |         | The file name of imported heterogeneous stress and friction parameters. |
| `Processors`                |         |             |
| `Processes`                 | 50      | The number of processes which can be scheduled by the operating system to run on different CPU cores. |
| `Batch_size`                | 1000    | The number of tasks for each batch of processes. If out of memory, Please reduce the size of Processes and Batch size|
| `H-matrix`                  | False   | If `True`, The kernel function will be approximated using HMatrix. Note that in this case, the code must be run under Linux system. The H-Matrix approximation is implemented using the open-source C library H2Lib, and the compilation of the dynamic library is done based on a Makefile. |
Note:
If you want to modify the matrix-vector multiplication computation in hmatrix, you can find the C source code in the H2Lib-master/mytest directory. The related Python source code is located in H2Lib-master/hmatrix.py. After making the modifications, recompile the code using make to generate a new hm.so dynamic library, and replace the dynamic library file in the src directory.

If InputHetoparamter is 'False', you may build the model by modifying the 'Stress Settings','Friction Settings' and 'Nucleation Settings':
